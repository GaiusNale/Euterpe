[Intro: Big Sean]
Ugh (
Cannon
)
[Chorus: Big Sean, 
James Fauntleroy
]
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hunnid things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life, 
la-da-da
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hunnid things to do before I die
Wonderin' if I could live it all in one life
'Cause it could all end in one night, 
la-da-da
La-da-da, da
La-da-da
, as I look up to the sky
I thought about a hunnid things to do before I die
[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Couple niggas on a hit list and bitches on a different type
Same shit, different nights, 'til I live a different life
"Sean, you lookin' tired," damn, homie, that's all?
I've been stressin' so hard I'm surprised I ain't goin' bald
Haters prayin' I fall, move back in with my moms
Take online classes and turn back into y'all, hatin'
I guess they want your lights out when you the plug
Niggas wanna catch you slippin' like they pulled the rug
From where they move the drugs
, Buddha love
Niggas sleepin' with that MAC and I ain't talkin' 'bout computer love
Owe the wrong people, you a price tag
Now you pray to God, hopin' that you got a Christ tag (God)
Make it where I'm from, stay who I become
Time to raise hell, Satan ain't my son
Take a elevator straight up out the slums to a penthouse view
And have the fam there, too, ugh
[Chorus: Big Sean, 
James Fauntleroy
]
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hunnid things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life, 
la-da-da
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hunnid things to do before I die
Wonderin' if I could live it all in one life
'Cause it could all end in one night, 
la-da-da
La-da-da, da
La-da-da
, as I look up to the sky
I thought about a hunnid things to do before I die
[Post-Chorus: James Fauntleroy, 
Royce da 5'9"
]
Ooh-ooh
If I just stop
Breathin'
Even though I got all this motherfuckin'
Money
Won't keep my heart
Beatin'
Just don't wake me
Up (Don't wake me up)
You can't catch me
Dreamin'
About all of this motherfuckin'
Money
Cocaine rush, I'm
Speedin'
Cocaine rush (
Yeah
)
[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]
I'm just a Detroit nigga, nuttin' extra about me
I go extra harder the first second you doubt me
I strive for perfection; at the same time
I'm acceptin' the fact that there'll never be nothin' perfect about me
Shit, I'm just waitin' on a win
Come up with better hooks, the hoes'll take it on the chin
We are 6 Mile-bred
, that's why you see our sick style, yeah
Crackhouse flow with a pit downstairs
Momma happy at me, daddy happy at me
The baddest chicks, as y'all can imagine, is chatty, yappin' at me
Five years ago I was in tears
In the back of a paddy wagon, 
now I'm Cali swaggin'
Huh, my nigga, listen, I'm over the fame
You number one? I'm number 23, my mission
Is to take over the game
, you rollin' with lames?
We ain't rollin' the same, I'm the best out in this motherfucker
If I could get a check out of this motherfucker
Big enough to set my kids up for life
I could check out of this motherfucker with no regrets
If you ain't livin' your life for your kids, I ain't givin' your ass no respect
[Chorus: Big Sean, 
James Fauntleroy
, 
Royce da 5'9"
]
As I look up to the sky 
(
Sean, I love you, my nigga, I'm out
)
Thought about a hunnid things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life, 
la-da-da
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hunnid things to do before I die
Wonderin' if I could live it all in one life
'Cause it could all end in one night, 
la-da-da
La-da-da, da
La-da-da
, as I look up to the sky
I thought about a hunnid things to do before I die
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I gotta break your fuckin' heart
I gotta climb these fuckin' charts (I gotta climb 'em)
I gotta do something that's innovative, creative, just to create a
Legacy before death do us part
, 
I gotta spend one
Summer in Tijuana with Tia and Tia's momma
Breakfast in bed is head with plenty Carne Asada
I gotta, I gotta find me a wife to elope
I got a—I got a fine, 'cause I ain't wanna vote, I promise
I know the history of those who died
For the rights for me to survive
 
but those who lied
To the minority will make 'em turn inside they grave
I can easily pretend like y'all but that's not me
I gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt
The youths need to know every detail about this Earth
The Devil controls it
, 
so before you scrutinize how I feel
Ask God if them polls important
, 
the end is near
[Chorus: Big Sean, 
James Fauntleroy
]
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hunnid things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life, 
la-da-da
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hunnid things to do before I die
Wonderin' if I could live it all in one life
'Cause it could all end in one night, 
la-da-da
La-da-da, da
La-da-da
, as I look up to the sky
I thought about a hunnid things to do before I die

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Priceless with the life, rollin' on them dice
Spent a mil' on a flight

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You was a college student abusin' the credit union
The music was way too loud, that tuition was fuckin' stupid
And me, I was runnin' wild, hittin' licks in my mother's Buick
Confusin', you like my style even though I was broke and doin'
Stick-'em-ups, you wanna pick 'em up inside your Civic Plus
The difference was I wasn't rich as fuck, you still would depend on us
And I miss the crush that we had every time winter, December come
And we had tempers and arguments, disagreements and senses from
Cupid himself, and I'm shootin' himself
And the paramedics won't come even if you scream for help
Don't let love die, you regroovin' yourself
And I'm losin' out too lookin' at you boohoo from what's dealt
So as I reminisce the coupon that we used to split at Rally's
On your mother's couch, your little brother in the alley
You said, "K. Dot, your pace got the pay that Birdman and Jay got
One day you'll reap what you sow," now I reap for us both
That's one hundred
[Pre-Chorus: Detail]
Now I'm sittin' here sippin' on the last bit of vodka
And all I ever see is your face
And I been sittin' here thinkin' 'bout the shit that you be doin'
And all I know is I owe you a
[Chorus: Detail]
Hundred, hundred, a hundred favors
I'll do you a hundred favors
Hundred, hundred, a hundred favors
Yeah
And now I'm sittin' here sippin' on the last bit of GT
And all I ever see is your face
A hundred favors
Oh, nothing less
Hundred, hundred

### 100 Yard Dash ###
[Intro]
Everybody get the fuck down now
Soul in the building
Yeah, we taking everything
Everything you got
[Verse 1]
Hit the deck I need everything you possess
I suggest you cooperate for this tech
Send you to the doctor to operate
You complicate my scheme to get rich
I'll put this heat to your T, let it steam a little bit
Look, when the chips get low, my fifth just blow
Anything that I could pawn, come about that, dog
It's money to be made and if you got it I'm taking it
Just run it like a Jamaican and shut the fuck up, nigga
[Hook]
And that might leave more than a rash
I'm coming for your ass
Please hand me the cash
Cause when I'm down on my last
I gotta re-up fast
Point me to your stash
Don't make me say it again
Before I lay you with Reagan, Benjamin Franklin, and them
Frankly I'm a menace
In fact I'm ready to blast
So whatever you got, run it
Like a 100 yard dash
[Verse 2]
Coming for you
Don't let me catch you slipping in that pretty whip you dip in
You would get pulled out
Like my dick in these women when I'm finna bust, don't test my clout
Your execution is a must, no doubt
For the longest niggas been taking my kindness for weakness
But this trigger is killing me and I'm just dying to squeeze it
Fire for hire, don't let your murder transpire
Thinking you will live forever like a fucking vampire
I arose from the dark to claim everything you own
And there's nothing between us but opportunity and this chrome
It don't take a genius to know I mean this, so ante up
Before I load the cannon up and blow your ass to Canada
Nigga
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I'm wild with it, pistol whip whoever's in the house with it
Call the cops, tell 'em like a date, I'm going out with it
Give me the goods, give me the hand me downs
Tell your wife to pull her panties down
I need those too, what you gon' do?
Don't jeopardize your life, for the nigga hard body made of cement
Plus I'm loaded like this clip, off of the Seagrams
Lay you on the floor like granite
Granted your granny watching, I'm grinning like I ain't just hit 'em
Better believe it, my head's sort of off, shit
I would have robbed Jesus for the cross if I caught him slipping
God forgive him for this long arm like Pippen
The cars honk but times is hard hard and I gotta eat
Give me the watch, the Sean-John, even your sneaks
Give me your socks, your drawers, your fitted, your Boost minutes
Give me your stocks, your bonds, your blunts, your bongs
Your food in the fridge, your iPod, your celly
You say I'm wrong but I'm deadly
That's dead wrong so I'm heavy
Like Chris Wallace, regardless
You're getting stuck up, pussy
Like a tampon with a handgun, push me
But I ain't on the swings, I got this infrared beam and it wouldn't miss a thing
Bow!
[Outro]
Chyea! Rose
I got you nigga
I want everything
I want the jewels, the watches, the bling bling, all that shit
All y'all little niggas getting your chains robbed
I'm on you
I'm just playing y'all, I wouldn't hurt a fly
Came out dope though
Carson arsonist
Yeah, it's funny that you say Carson-Carson arsonist
That's where you're from right? Carson?
Yes, yes sir
Where is that exactly? If I looked on a map, where would I be lookin'?
Carson is right in between Compton and Long Beach
Shout out to Carson, Del Amo, that's where I'm from though, DA

### 16 ###
[Refrain]
Born into status, tell nobody that you never had it
Don't tell nobody that you was abandoned
I'm the only one that know about your tragedy
I can't feel sorry when you lost random
I can't feel sorry, you're a lost ransom
Drown yourself in expensive fabrics
I think you picked up a lot of bad habits
Just appreciate yourself
[Chorus]
Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye
But this ain't something you should decide
This ain't something that you should decide
Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye
But this ain't something you should decide
This ain't something that you should decide
[Refrain]
Born into status, tell nobody that you never had it
Don't tell nobody that you was abandonеd
I'm the only one that know about your tragedy
I can't feel sorry 'causе your trust random
I can't feel sorry, you're a lost ransom
Drown yourself in expensive fabrics
I think you picked up a lot of bad habits
Just appreciate yourself
[Chorus]
Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye
But this ain't something you should decide
This ain't something that you should decide
Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye
But this ain't something you should decide
This ain't something that you should decide
[Verse]
My mama mad at me, I know I fucked up big
My girl mad at me, I know I fucked up big
What's love? I guess I'll never understand
Every time I say sorry, I do that shit again
Check, check, check, I made a promise
That I would never leave you stressed, I would be honest
I should have never sent that text, I will be honest
I'm sorry for the things I said, I will be honest
[Chorus]
Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye
But this ain't something you should decide
This ain't something that you should decide
Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye
But this ain't something you should decide
This ain't something that you should decide

### 1Train ###
[Produced by Hit-Boy]
[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, feelin' like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers, get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetery with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinkin' 'bout all the O's in my bank account (What?)
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out, huh
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, 
cheffin' like I'm Boyar—
Dee,
 probably sellin' D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, 
my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
We outlawed, then I bogart,
 
any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off in the projects 
with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all 
like, "Doo, doo," I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, "Mmm, mmm!"
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9s on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say R.I.P.,
 I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must have froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed to
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed to, 
I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff
[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
Barely even conscious, 
talkin' to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately, I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail but when I preach I only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real
[Verse 4: Yelawolf]
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park, dirt-ditch-diggin'
Burger-flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body-double or couple me to these others
'Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, 
my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians,
 new beginnin' again
You in school at 10, late, 
Radioactive
's goin' gold
And so? Great! Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up—wait! No, I don't give a
Flying duck nothin' but a buckshot; ch-pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood-clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show—Yelawolf
[Verse 5: Danny Brown]
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy 'cause I'm high like Michael Jackson, penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch, when I say this, I mean this
Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, it's like from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, 
aw, shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that "suck my cock" shit
That is my synopsis, 
ostrich's posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka, prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic, 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?
[Verse 6: Action Bronson]
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker, so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should have stayed with me
Now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the mornin' on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', 
drinkin' Henny 
like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin', I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scramblin', sellin' Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn, this shit tastes like fantastic, uh
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I've got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I'm a free man, try not to eat ham
[Verse 7: Big K.R.I.T.]
Big K.R.I.T., shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'lac with flats
After that, bottles I can't pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love and all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm, slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I've been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I'm taxin' if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin' grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my soul, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hopin' the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you'll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
(That wasn't no sample, nigga!)
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag,
 poppin' benji tags on your wifey's ass (on your wifey's ass)
That's out of line, but in livin' color?
I'm more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers: a true artist
