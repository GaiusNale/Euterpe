### 100 ###
[Intro: Big Sean]
Ugh (
Cannon
)
[Chorus: Big Sean, 
James Fauntleroy
]
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hunnid things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life, 
la-da-da
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hunnid things to do before I die
Wonderin' if I could live it all in one life
'Cause it could all end in one night, 
la-da-da
La-da-da, da
La-da-da
, as I look up to the sky
I thought about a hunnid things to do before I die
[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Couple niggas on a hit list and bitches on a different type
Same shit, different nights, 'til I live a different life
"Sean, you lookin' tired," damn, homie, that's all?
I've been stressin' so hard I'm surprised I ain't goin' bald
Haters prayin' I fall, move back in with my moms
Take online classes and turn back into y'all, hatin'
I guess they want your lights out when you the plug
Niggas wanna catch you slippin' like they pulled the rug
From where they move the drugs
, Buddha love
Niggas sleepin' with that MAC and I ain't talkin' 'bout computer love
Owe the wrong people, you a price tag
Now you pray to God, hopin' that you got a Christ tag (God)
Make it where I'm from, stay who I become
Time to raise hell, Satan ain't my son
Take a elevator straight up out the slums to a penthouse view
And have the fam there, too, ugh

### 100 Favors ###
[Intro: Detail]
Shout out
Oh, yeah, yeah
[Pre-Chorus: Detail]
Swear I been sittin' here thinkin' 'bout the shit that we be through
And all I know is, girl, I owe you
[Chorus: Detail]
A hundred, hundred, a hundred favors
I owe you a hundred favors
Hundred, hundred, hundred favors
Hundred favors
[Verse 1: Detail]
Niggas all talk, it'll never change
Keep on choosin', do your thang, girl
All them favors, I call her like a driver
Drownin' in that pussy and her the sole survivor
Vodka, hundred flavors, GT watermelon
She always do me favors, and I don't never tell her
GT yellow mango, I love to drink juice
Owe her a hundred favors, I call her my hundred proof
Man, I heard about an angel
[Pre-Chorus: Detail]
Now I'm sittin' here sippin' on the last bit of vodka
And all I ever see is your face
And I been sittin' here thinkin' 'bout the shit that you be doin'
And all I know is I owe you a

### 100 Yard Dash ###
[Intro]
Everybody get the fuck down now
Soul in the building
Yeah, we taking everything
Everything you got
[Verse 1]
Hit the deck I need everything you possess
I suggest you cooperate for this tech
Send you to the doctor to operate
You complicate my scheme to get rich
I'll put this heat to your T, let it steam a little bit
Look, when the chips get low, my fifth just blow
Anything that I could pawn, come about that, dog
It's money to be made and if you got it I'm taking it
Just run it like a Jamaican and shut the fuck up, nigga
[Hook]
And that might leave more than a rash
I'm coming for your ass
Please hand me the cash
Cause when I'm down on my last
I gotta re-up fast
Point me to your stash
Don't make me say it again
Before I lay you with Reagan, Benjamin Franklin, and them
Frankly I'm a menace
In fact I'm ready to blast
So whatever you got, run it
Like a 100 yard dash

### 16 ###
[Refrain]
Born into status, tell nobody that you never had it
Don't tell nobody that you was abandoned
I'm the only one that know about your tragedy
I can't feel sorry when you lost random
I can't feel sorry, you're a lost ransom
Drown yourself in expensive fabrics
I think you picked up a lot of bad habits
Just appreciate yourself
[Chorus]
Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye
But this ain't something you should decide
This ain't something that you should decide
Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye
But this ain't something you should decide
This ain't something that you should decide
[Refrain]
Born into status, tell nobody that you never had it
Don't tell nobody that you was abandonеd
I'm the only one that know about your tragedy
I can't feel sorry 'causе your trust random
I can't feel sorry, you're a lost ransom
Drown yourself in expensive fabrics
I think you picked up a lot of bad habits
Just appreciate yourself

### 1Train ###
[Produced by Hit-Boy]
[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, feelin' like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers, get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetery with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinkin' 'bout all the O's in my bank account (What?)
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out, huh
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, 
cheffin' like I'm Boyar—
Dee,
 probably sellin' D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, 
my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
We outlawed, then I bogart,
 
any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off in the projects 
with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all 
like, "Doo, doo," I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, "Mmm, mmm!"
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9s on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say R.I.P.,
 I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must have froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed to
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed to, 
I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff

### 2011 BET Hip Hop Awards - Indie Meets Mainstream Cypher ###
[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
They hollering at the K back
M.I crooked slay that, been killing beats since adapt
Yeah me and rhymes go way back, way back
Time machine flow when I was swanging and riding
If you ain’t repping for your people then you’re shucking and jiving
Tap dancing and sliding to beat that you can’t comprehend
How dare you speak on where I’m from if you ain't never been
Fried Kool-Aid who made, never ate that in fact
Grandma was chefing for real, made meals off love and scraps
Thank God for my country folk and family
Instead of a metaphor I’d rather take it by James Anderson
Damaging how they televised Basketball Wives
And not tornadoes in the South and how we lost lives
Still rebuilding, pray for the children that have no hero
Only the villains that tell them get money
Sleep when you die, I find it funny
Because when you rest in peace don’t mean fast asleep in slumber
Thank God and stay humble
[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Real rock, rap and not to Xerox, weird not
Enough to make you fear a lot from here watch
I ran scrimmage and I fought to the damn finish
And I popped eyes open without eating me canned spinach
My fans in it constantly tellin' me I can win it
If I stand grimace damagin' man every damn minute
I blend then expands quick it slams wicked rhyme
Grand spittage, H.A.M. with it, fam dig it's N9ne
Chea, hard to see me like the background
Your rap styles comin' softer than a cat’s meow
Red laces big-booted like I’m Iraq bound
That frown will get you ate by my cannibal from Sac Town
So relax pal, pat down, gat down, bat down, blackout
With a fat smile I might react foul, so don’t make this cat growl
I caught everybody when I spazzed, wow—who do I catch now?

### 2012 BET Hip Hop Awards - Cypher 5 ###
[Verse 1: Xzibit]
I'm heavy hearted, heavy handed, misunderstanded
Turn a permanent repercussion, I empty the cannon
I'm addicted to ganja, roll it up in the wood
Drink a gallon of Henny, throw it up for the hood
I'ma ride for my people, give my people a voice
Never followed a leader, use my weapon of choice
This is not an illusion, this is not a mirage
Conversation with God, spilling my soul out
I own assault weapons that fold out like Megatron
The iron long, drop bottom bombs on Babylon
So tag along like a dog with a vagabond
Smoke 'till the cess is gone
Niggas on their grind, put my motherfucking records on
So they can relate to the hate and the pain
To the struggle and strain
Never take it in vain, breathing one and the same
Pressure push your forehead out the back of your brain
So west
[Verse 2: YG]
'Bout to bring the coast back, 'bout to bring the coast back
Told them make it nasty like some motherfucking cognac
Pull up on your niggas like Jordan at the three line
Still in the hood, hanging like beehives
Your money like knee-high, my money like ye-high
I whip the Porsche like it's a horse, maybe say yee-ha
We striped like Adidas, and be bang like speakers
'Bout to cop a couple of houses and have more spots than cheetas
You sell with the coke, I sell with the flow
You off-brand rappers wouldn't sell/sail with a boat
You be tweeting a lot, you be talking too much
But when daytime pass, you still wouldn't bust
We can pinky-promise, but I still wouldn't trust
They talk down on me, but I still look up
Just was talking to Nip, he say he still fucked up
It's the westside, niggas get chipped like woodchuck

### 2013 BET Hip Hop Awards - TDE Cypher ###
[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Cypher
TDE
Schoolboy Q, what's hatnin'?
[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Most of these niggas shouldn't be next to us
We keep our distance from those, those acting like hoes
Xanny imposed, weed in my clothes, 
cubics is gold
Your wig'll get told, put the realest niggas
Niggas, product of cap-peelers, gangbangers, and dealers
Streets keep watching—"Oh, ayy..." click, boom
The ghetto bird get shot down, straight to the top now
They want a third strike on my background
But nah, homie, put the mask on when I slide on 'em
Put the cash in the safe, and here's a extra slug 'fore I shake
You smoke faster than me with a eighth
Or better yet, a wet break on a plate
Burning your faith, all your senses covered in tape
Fucking with them boys in blue
Chill out before I send them rags at you
You running to the cops saying, "How we do?"
Saying, "It's just rap, and them lines ain't true"
So I just do Q, fuck it, a ménage à two
Or maybe trois, baby girl need a papa, I be her da-da
Coochie spanking, give praise to Allah
Get blazed in my car, with 
Oxymoron
—Rock

[Intro: Bēkon]
America, God bless you if it's good to you
America, please take my hand
Can you help me underst—
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said: "K-Dot, can you pray for me?
Been a messed up day for me
Know that you anointed, show me how to overcome."
He was lookin' for some closure
I can bring him closer
Spiritual, my spirit do no better, but I told him
"I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody killed my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed."
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I'll wait in front a homie's spot and watch him hit his block
I'll catch the homie leavin' service if that's all I got
I'll chip a homie, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Man, I did that!"
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you play with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my mama
Touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece
Touch my nephew, man, I promise
You chip the homie, then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention
Call you back—

Gunshot
